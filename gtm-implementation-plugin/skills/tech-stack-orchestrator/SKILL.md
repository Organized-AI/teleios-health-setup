# Tech Stack Orchestrator

A meta-skill for orchestrating the complete Claude Code component ecosystem. Analyze projects, recommend components, create custom tools, and evaluate effectiveness before building.

## Component Taxonomy

Claude Code supports 6 component types, each serving distinct purposes:

| Type | Icon | Purpose | Location | Trigger |
|------|------|---------|----------|---------|
| **Agent** | 🤖 | Specialized AI personas with domain expertise | `.claude/agents/` | `/agent:name` or auto-detection |
| **Command** | ⚡ | Slash commands for quick actions | `.claude/commands/` | `/command-name` |
| **Setting** | ⚙️ | Configuration presets | `.claude/settings.json` | Auto-applied |
| **Hook** | 🪝 | Event-triggered automation | `.claude/hooks/` | Pre/post tool events |
| **MCP** | 🔌 | External service integrations | `.claude/mcp.json` | Tool availability |
| **Skill** | 🎨 | Complex capability packages | `.claude/skills/` | Context-triggered |

---

## Orchestration Workflow

### Phase 1: Project Analysis

When analyzing a project for tech stack recommendations:

```
1. GATHER: Collect project context
   - What type of project? (web app, CLI, API, mobile, etc.)
   - What technologies? (React, Python, Node, etc.)
   - What workflows? (git, CI/CD, testing, etc.)
   - What integrations? (databases, APIs, services)
   - Team size and experience level?

2. IDENTIFY: Determine needs by category
   - Development personas needed (agents)
   - Repetitive actions to automate (commands)
   - Environment configurations (settings)
   - Event-driven automations (hooks)
   - External service connections (MCPs)
   - Complex capability packages (skills)

3. MATCH: Map needs to existing components
   - Reference the component library (see references/component-library.md)
   - Identify gaps requiring custom components
   - Note synergies between components
```

### Phase 2: Stack Recommendation

Provide structured recommendations with effectiveness analysis:

```markdown
## Recommended Tech Stack for [Project Name]

### 🤖 Agents (n selected)
| Component | Why | Synergies |
|-----------|-----|-----------|
| [name] | [reasoning] | Works with [x, y] |

### ⚡ Commands (n selected)
...

### ⚙️ Settings (n selected)
...

### 🪝 Hooks (n selected)
...

### 🔌 MCPs (n selected)
...

### 🎨 Skills (n selected)
...

### Effectiveness Score: X/10
- Coverage: How well does this stack cover project needs?
- Synergy: How well do components work together?
- Efficiency: Are there redundancies or gaps?

### Installation Command
\`\`\`bash
npx organized-ai install [component-list]
\`\`\`
```

### Phase 3: Custom Component Creation

When existing components don't meet needs, create custom ones.

## Creating Custom Components

### 🤖 Creating Agents

Agents are specialized AI personas with domain expertise.

**File Structure:**
```
.claude/agents/
└── agent-name.md
```

**Agent Template:**
```markdown
---
name: agent-name
description: When to invoke this agent and what it specializes in
---

# Agent Name

## Role
[Define the persona and expertise]

## Responsibilities
- [Key responsibility 1]
- [Key responsibility 2]

## Guidelines
- [How the agent should behave]
- [What it should prioritize]

## Tools & Patterns
- [Preferred tools and workflows]
```

**Best Practices:**
- Use PROACTIVELY in description to indicate auto-invocation
- Keep focused on single domain
- Include concrete examples of when to activate

---

### ⚡ Creating Commands

Commands are slash-triggered actions for repetitive tasks.

**File Structure:**
```
.claude/commands/
└── command-name.md
```

**Command Template:**
```markdown
---
name: command-name
description: What this command does when invoked
---

# Command: /command-name

## Purpose
[What problem this solves]

## Usage
\`\`\`
/command-name [arguments]
\`\`\`

## Behavior
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Step 3]

## Examples
- `/command-name file.ts` - [result]
```

**Best Practices:**
- Name should be action-oriented (verb-noun)
- Keep commands focused on single task
- Include clear argument documentation

---

### ⚙️ Creating Settings

Settings configure Claude Code behavior.

**File Structure:**
```
.claude/settings.json
```

**Settings Template:**
```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": ["npm test", "npm run build"],
    "deny": ["rm -rf"]
  },
  "preferences": {
    "autoCommit": false,
    "lintOnSave": true
  },
  "environment": {
    "terminal": "zsh",
    "editor": "vscode"
  }
}
```

**Common Settings Categories:**
- `permissions`: Allow/deny bash commands
- `mcp`: MCP server configurations
- `statusline`: Custom status line display
- `telemetry`: Usage tracking preferences

---

### 🪝 Creating Hooks

Hooks are event-triggered automations.

**File Structure:**
```
.claude/hooks/
└── hook-name.md
```

**Hook Template:**
```markdown
---
name: hook-name
description: What this hook does and when it triggers
trigger: [PreToolUse|PostToolUse|PreMessage|PostMessage]
tools: [Edit|Write|Bash|*]  # Which tools trigger this
---

# Hook: hook-name

## Trigger Conditions
- Event: [when this fires]
- Filter: [which operations]

## Behavior
[What the hook does]

## Implementation
\`\`\`bash
#!/bin/bash
# Hook script
[commands]
\`\`\`
```

**Trigger Types:**
| Trigger | When |
|---------|------|
| `PreToolUse` | Before a tool executes |
| `PostToolUse` | After a tool completes |
| `PreMessage` | Before Claude responds |
| `PostMessage` | After Claude responds |

---

### 🔌 Creating MCPs

MCPs connect Claude to external services.

**For detailed MCP creation, load:** `references/mcp-creation-guide.md`

**Quick Reference - MCP Structure:**
```
mcp-name/
├── package.json
├── src/
│   └── index.ts
└── README.md
```

**MCP Configuration:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "server-name": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "package-name"],
      "env": {
        "API_KEY": "${API_KEY}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Key Considerations:**
- Use TypeScript with Zod for type safety
- Implement proper error handling with actionable messages
- Support pagination for list operations
- Include tool annotations (readOnly, destructive, idempotent)

---

### 🎨 Creating Skills

Skills are complex capability packages.

**For detailed skill creation, load:** `references/skill-creation-guide.md`

**Quick Reference - Skill Structure:**
```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md (required)
├── scripts/     (optional - executable code)
├── references/  (optional - documentation)
└── assets/      (optional - templates, images)
```

**SKILL.md Template:**
```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: Comprehensive description of what this skill does and when to use it. Include trigger phrases and contexts.
---

# Skill Name

## Overview
[What this skill enables]

## Workflow
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]

## Resources
- scripts/tool.py - [purpose]
- references/guide.md - [when to load]
```

---

## Effectiveness Analysis

Before finalizing a tech stack, evaluate it:

### Coverage Matrix

```
Project Need          | Component          | Coverage
---------------------|--------------------|---------
[need 1]             | [component]        | ✅/⚠️/❌
[need 2]             | [component]        | ✅/⚠️/❌
```

### Synergy Analysis

Identify component pairs that enhance each other:
- Agent + Hook: Agent triggers hook for automation
- Command + Setting: Command uses setting configurations
- MCP + Skill: Skill leverages MCP for external data

### Gap Analysis

Identify what's missing:
- Uncovered needs requiring custom components
- Over-coverage where multiple components overlap
- Integration points that need bridging

### Scoring Rubric

| Score | Coverage | Synergy | Efficiency |
|-------|----------|---------|------------|
| 10 | 100% needs met | All components synergize | No redundancy |
| 7-9 | 80%+ needs met | Most synergize | Minor overlap |
| 4-6 | 50%+ needs met | Some synergy | Notable gaps |
| 1-3 | <50% needs met | Little synergy | Major issues |
